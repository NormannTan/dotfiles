## Python Workspace Setup

When you’re beginning, it’s pretty easy to setup your Python environment on
Unix. But in time things can get messy due to multiple versions, interpreters,
utilities and projects.

#### Setup requirements?

I have a few needs and restrictions:

1.  I need CPython 2.7 and 3.6, but I want to be able to install other interpreters
like PyPy and Anaconda;
1.  Python3 must be the default for **EVERYTHING**, but easily step back when I need
Python2.
1.  I want **one** *Jupyter Notebook* that works both with Python2 and Python3,
**and both are able to detect the active virtualenv** at jupyter notebook
execution time.
1.  I want **one** *iPython Console for Python3* and **one** *iPython Console for
Python2*, so no need to install iPython on my projects’ virtualenvs.
1.  I want useful programs written in Python *(ex: youtube-dl)* globally available
on my system without contaminating the global interpreters and avoiding any
library version issues.
1.  I want to use virtualenvwrapper to develop my projects allowing me to change
context/project quickly with **one** command.
1.  I want this setup to be maintainable without adding too many thing to PATH.

#### What is the best way to install Python on a Unix?

For me [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) is the best way to install Python
on a Mac or Linux. Everything gets installed under your home directoy, without
tampering with the rest of the system. Besides that, it supports many different
Python implementation such as PyPy, Anaconda, CPython, etc. All with **one**
command.

First we need to install [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and two of its
extensions, [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv) and
[pyenv-virtualenvwrapper](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper). I
use each one for different purposes:

1.  I use *pyenv* to install Python interpreters;
1.  I use *pyenv-virtualenv* to configure my “global environment”;
1.  I use *pyenv-virtualenvwrapper* to work on my projects;

Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install *pyenv* on a Mac. If you use other
*OS*, [check out the documentation](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#installation).

    brew install pyenv
    brew install pyenv-virtualenv
    brew install pyenv-virtualenvwrapper

With *virtualenvwrapper* all your *virtualenvs* are kept on a same directory and
your projects’ code on another. My setup is:

    # All virtualenvs will be on...
    mkdir ~/.ve
    # All projects will be on...
    mkdir ~/workspace

It’s necessary to configure the *shell* to initialize *pyenv* when you start a
terminal session. Put the lines bellow on your ~/.bashrc file:

    export WORKON_HOME=~/.ve
    export PROJECT_HOME=~/workspace
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    #pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy

1.  Note that there is a # at the beginning of the last line to keep
*pyenv-virtualenvwrapper* from starting at this first moment. We’ll get back to
it later.
1.  Also note that I **did not** include the command *pyenv virtualenv init* in
~/.bashrc [unlike the documentation
suggests](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv#installation). This is on
purpose: activate both extensions [causes
conflicts](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper/issues/28#issuecomment-177051559).

Now we must **restart the terminal session** closing its window and opening a
new one.

The next step is to install **CPython 3.6.0** and **CPython 2.7.13**.

    pyenv install 3.6.0
    pyenv install 2.7.13

#### Resist the temptation to contaminate your global Python install

I frequently use programs written in Python. I like them to be available in all
sessions **without activate any virtualenv**.

However I don’t like to mess with the global Python installation to avoid
library conflict issues.

Another thing that I don’t like is installing Jupyter/iPython on each of my
projects’ virtualenvs.

I like to have only **one** install of *Jupyter Notebook* , one of *iPython
Console for Python3*, one of *iPython Console for Python2*, and other tools like
[youtube-dl](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/youtube_dl),
[rename](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rename),
[gnucash-to-beancount](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnucash-to-beancount),
[rows](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rows),
[s3cmd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/s3cmd),
[fabric](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fabric/1.13.1),
[mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), etc.

This is where *pyenv-virtualenv* comes to play, with 4 *special* virtualenvs:

    pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 jupyter3
    pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 tools3
    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.13 ipython2
    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.13 tools2

*Jupyter* supports many *kernels*. This allows a single **Jupyter** install to
create *notebooks* for Python2, Python3, R, Bash and many other languages. *At
this time I only want to support Python2 and Python3*.

Let’s start with *Python3*:

    pyenv activate jupyter3
    pip install jupyter
    python -m ipykernel install --user
    pyenv deactivate

Then *Python2*:

    pyenv activate ipython2
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user
    pyenv deactivate

Note that when I install Jupyter on Python3 it will by default install iPython
and the Kernel too. For Python2 I only need to install iPython and the Kernel.
I’ll explain this better bellow.

Now let’s install tools which run on Python3:

    pyenv activate tools3
    pip install youtube-dl gnucash-to-beancount rows
    pyenv deactivate

Now we install tools which **do not** run on Python3… but still run on Python2.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    pyenv activate tools2
    pip install rename s3cmd fabric mercurial
    pyenv deactivate

Finally, it’s time to make all *Python versions* and *special virtualenvs* work
with each other.

    pyenv global 3.6.0 2.7.13 jupyter3 ipython2 tools3 tools2

The above command establishes the PATH priority so scripts can be accessed in
the right order **without activating any virtualenv**.

ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪

To better understand the result, check out how the *shell* finds each command:

    ~$ pyenv which python
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/3.6.0/bin/python
    ~$ pyenv which python2
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/2.7.13/bin/python2
    ~$ pyenv which jupyter
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/jupyter3/bin/jupyter
    ~$ pyenv which ipython
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/jupyter3/bin/ipython
    ~$ pyenv which ipython2
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/ipython2/bin/ipython2
    ~$ pyenv which youtube-dl
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/tools3/bin/youtube-dl
    ~$ pyenv which rename
    /Users/henrique/.pyenv/versions/tools2/bin/rename

#### What about my projects’ virtualenvs?

I use *pyenv-virtualenvwrapper* to create my projects’ virtualenvs. This
extension does very little: only fixes the *virtualenvwrapper* library to work
correctly with the interpreters installed via *pyenv*.

Now **uncomment** the line #pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy on your ~/.bashrc and
**restart the terminal**, closing its window and opening a new one.

When you start the new session *pyenv-virtualenvwrapper* will install the
virtualenvwrapper’s dependencies if they’re not present.

Now you can simply use [virtualenvwrapper’s
commands](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html)
and each virtualenv will be created using the Python interpreters installed via
*pyenv*.

A few examples:

1.  Say I want to start a new project *proj3* with Python3. Running mkproject proj3
will create a *virtualenv with Python3* (default) at ~/.ve/proj3 and an empty
project directory at ~/workspace/proj3 .
1.  Now say I just opened the terminal and want to work on my new *proj3*. Running
workon proj3 will activate the virtualenv ~/.ve/proj3 and change the current
directory to ~/workspace/proj3.
1.  Let’s say I just *cloned* a project called *proj2* which runs on Python2 at
~/workspace/proj2 and I need a virtualenv to work on it. Running mkvirtualenv -a
~/workspace/proj2 -p python2 proj2 will create a *virtualenv with Python2* at
~/.ve/proj2 associating to it the project directory ~/workspace/proj2. Then
running workon proj2 will activate the virtualenv and change the directory to
the project’s path.

#### How to use Jupyter and iPython with my projects?

This was the main motivation to write this guide.

Both *Notebook* and *Console* were part of the *iPython* project, which, as the
name suggests, were only about Python. But the *Notebook* evolution enabled it
to become language agnostic, so developers decided to split the project in 2:
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [iPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/)

Now *Jupyter* contains *Notebook*, while *iPython* contains *Console* and the
**Python Kernel** which *Jupyter* uses to execute Python code.

I used to use an old iPython version and during a clumsy upgrade Jupyter stopped
detecting the active virtualenv, so I couldn’t import its installed libraries.

Actually, Jupyter does not detect the active virtualenv: it’s the iPython
instance which Jupyter initializes. The problem then is that iPython’s
virtualenv detection code only runs in the *interactive shell mode*, but not in
the *kernel mode*. [Check out the
culprit](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L676).

Besides that the detection code only works properly if the active virtualenv’s
Python version and the Python version running iPython are the same.

(>ლ)

The solution is to customize iPython’s startup process. For that we need to
create an *iPython profile* and install [a magic script I wrote to do the
trick](https://gist.github.com/henriquebastos/270cff100cb303f3d74370489022446b):

    ipython profile create
    curl -L
     > ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-venv-sitepackages.py

With this, no matter the mode iPython starts, the virtualenv’s site-packages
will be available in the PYTHONPATH.

Back to our *proj3*, after activating its virtualenv running workon proj3, you
can simply execute ipython to run the interactive mode, or jupyter notebook to
get all the fun.
